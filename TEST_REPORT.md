# Test Report – LifeOS Skeleton

This document summarizes the local tests and stress experiments carried out to validate the **LifeOS Skeleton** framework.  
It serves as **proof of concept** and demonstrates stability, reproducibility, and the ability to scale.

---

## 1. Standard Test Suite

Command:

```powershell
py -m pytest -v
Results:
✅ 11 tests passed successfully

Covered: genome encoding/decoding, trait mapping, reproduction, policy selection, lineage tracking, and multiverse engine integration

Location: /tests/

2. Pipeline Verification
Special test file: tests/test_pipeline_small.py

Command:

powershell
Copy code
py -m pytest tests/test_pipeline_small.py -v
Results:
✅ Verified run_experiment.py executes correctly with configs/sample_small.yaml

✅ Confirmed runs/ directory creation and artifact generation

Output files: metrics.csv, lineage.json, and metrics.png

3. Stress Tests
Configuration: configs/stress_extreme.yaml

Key parameters:

population_size: 2000

generations: 1000

max_offspring_per_pair: 4

Command:

powershell
Copy code
py run_experiment.py --config configs/stress_extreme.yaml
Results:
✅ Experiment executed and completed

Artifacts saved under:

runs/EXP_20250922_125717_stress_extreme/

runs/EXP_20250922_141233_multiverse_smoke/

Each world produced:

metrics.csv (numeric logs)

metrics.png (visualization of avg_energy and genetic_diversity)

lineage.json (ancestry trace)

4. Resource Monitoring
During stress tests, monitor_resources.py was executed in parallel:

powershell
Copy code
py monitor_resources.py --interval 5 --log monitor_log.csv
Findings:
CPU usage spiked to 95–100% during peak generations

RAM usage stabilized at ~80% with large populations

No crashes; long runs completed successfully

Logs: monitor_log.csv

5. Aggregated Results
The script analyze_results.py was used to generate global summaries.

Command:

powershell
Copy code
py analyze_results.py --runs runs
Outputs:
runs/summary.csv → Final metrics snapshot per world

metrics.png files inside each experiment folder

Example metrics columns:

last_generation

last_avg_energy

last_genetic_diversity

6. Key Takeaways
✅ Core pipeline functions under standard and extreme conditions

✅ Reproducible outputs with clear metrics and lineage tracking

✅ Stress conditions validated framework scalability

⚠️ Resource-heavy configs may cause CPU/RAM strain → use monitoring tools

7. Next Steps
Add automated visualization hooks into CI/CD

Expand stress configs to include mutation edge cases

Compare outcomes across multiple seeds for reproducibility

Publish selected metrics and graphs in project documentation
