# Test Report – LifeOS Skeleton

This report documents local verification and stress testing of the **LifeOS Skeleton** framework.  
All experiments and analysis were run on a Windows 10 machine using Python 3.13.7.  

---

## 1. Scope

- ✅ Validate that all **unit tests** pass.  
- ✅ Verify the **pipeline** from genome → traits → behavior → reproduction → lineage.  
- ✅ Run **stress tests** (small → medium → large → extreme).  
- ✅ Monitor **system resources** during stress runs.  
- ✅ Aggregate results into summary + charts.

---

## 2. Unit Test Results

Executed via:

    py -m pytest -v

Results:

- ✅ 11 tests passed  
- Coverage: genome encoding/decoding, trait mapping, reproduction, policy selection, lineage tracking, and multiverse engine.

---

## 3. Pipeline Verification

Special pipeline test:

    py -m pytest tests/test_pipeline_small.py -v

Results:

- ✅ run_experiment.py executed correctly with configs/sample_small.yaml  
- ✅ Artifacts created in /runs/:  
  - metrics.csv  
  - lineage.json  

Proof: runs/ directory auto-populated.

---

## 4. Stress Test Results

### Configurations

- stress_medium.yaml → population: 500, generations: 200  
- stress_large.yaml → population: 1000, generations: 500  
- stress_extreme.yaml → population: 2000, generations: 1000  

### Worlds Simulated
- baseline  
- spiritual_communal  
- adaptive  
- competitive  

### Outputs per run
- metrics.csv → average energy + genetic diversity  
- lineage.json → ancestry tree  

---

## 5. Resource Monitoring

Script: monitor_resources.py  
Output: runs/system_monitor.csv  

Key findings:  
- CPU usage spiked at ~90% under stress_extreme  
- Memory sustained at ~75%  
- No crash or data loss  

This confirms the framework can scale to extreme configs.
