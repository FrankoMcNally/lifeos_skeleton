# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned direction and milestones for the **LifeOS Skeleton** project.  
It will evolve as the project grows and contributions are made.

---

## üöÄ Short-Term Goals (v0.x)
- [x] Establish initial project structure (`lifeos_skeleton/`)
- [x] Add testing framework with pytest
- [x] Provide sample configs for running simple pipelines
- [x] Create core documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE.md`)
- [ ] Refine module interconnections (genome, lineage, traits, multiverse)

---

## üìà Medium-Term Goals (v1.x)
- [ ] Expand DNA-inspired simulation features
- [ ] Add reproducible experiment runner with logs and metrics
- [ ] Implement visualization tools for family trees and multiverse dynamics
- [ ] Improve CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Publish initial release package to PyPI

---

## üåç Long-Term Goals (v2.x and beyond)
- [ ] Support large-scale multiverse simulations with parallel execution
- [ ] Introduce advanced modules (e.g., emergent behaviors, subconscious layers)
- [ ] Add support for synthetic DNA inputs for testing
- [ ] Explore real-world applications (neural link systems, autonomous vehicles, android integration)
- [ ] Collaborate with research communities to extend LifeOS as a standard simulation framework
