Roadmap – LifeOS Skeleton
==========================

This roadmap outlines the planned direction and milestones for the LifeOS
Skeleton project. It will evolve as the project grows and contributions are made.

---

🚀 Current Status (v2.1 – SentientMind MK7 Integration)
--------------------------------------------------------
• Core engine stable: genome → traits → behavior → reproduction → lineage.  
• Adam & Eve structured lineage module validated.  
• Stress tests executed (medium → extreme).  
• MK7 Sentient agent integrated:
  - Curiosity, competence, social bond, stress layers.  
  - Dream and memory_trace buffers.  
  - Partner selection and memory consolidation.  
• Test suite complete:
  - Standard pipeline tests.  
  - Adam & Eve lineage tests.  
  - Extreme stress tests.  
  - Sentient integration tests.  
• Documentation aligned (README, CHANGELOG, TEST_REPORT_SENTIENT).  
• Repo public on GitHub for reproducible runs.  

---

📈 Near-Term Goals (v2.2)
--------------------------
• Add visualization:
  - Line charts for energy, curiosity, stress, diversity.  
  - Animated lineage trees or generational plots.  
• Extend metrics:
  - Log MK7 states (curiosity, stress, dreams) to CSV for analysis.  
• Comparative runs:
  - Side-by-side MK6 vs MK7 survival curves.  
  - PSAI vs baseline partner dynamics.  
• Package and publish first GitHub release (`v2.1`).  
• Begin preparing PyPI distribution for reproducible installs.  

---

🌍 Medium-Term Goals (v2.3–v3.x)
---------------------------------
• Extend environment:
  - Advanced farming yields, role specialization.  
  - Ecosystem-style resource pools (food, oxygen, minerals).  
• Policy expansion:
  - Curiosity-driven, adversarial, cooperative economic roles.  
• Visualization dashboard:
  - Web or notebook-based front end for exploring runs interactively.  
• Community configs:
  - Curated experiments in `configs/` folder for reproducible studies.  
• Educational use case:
  - Build classroom-ready demos (editable configs + reports).  

---

🔮 Long-Term Goals (Beyond v3.x)
--------------------------------
• Large-scale multiverse simulations with parallel execution.  
• Neural and ML integration:
  - Reinforcement learning agents inside LifeOS.  
  - Hybrid Sentient + neural policies.  
• Real-world applications:
  - Complex systems research (resource scarcity, collapse modeling).  
  - AI safety / collective intelligence testbed.  
  - Simulation/game AI for emergent NPC populations.  
• Collaborations with researchers, educators, and developers to extend LifeOS
  as a shared artificial life standard.  

---

🤝 How to Contribute
---------------------
• See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.  
• Discussions and feature proposals are welcome via Issues and Pull Requests.

📌 Note
--------
This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as milestones are achieved.
