Roadmap ‚Äì LifeOS Skeleton
==========================

This roadmap outlines the planned direction and milestones for the LifeOS
Skeleton project. It will evolve as the project grows and contributions are made.


üöÄ Short-Term Goals (v0.x)
---------------------------
‚Ä¢ Establish initial project structure (lifeos_skeleton/)
‚Ä¢ Add testing framework with pytest (document py vs python sensitivity for Windows)
‚Ä¢ Provide sample configs for running simple pipelines
‚Ä¢ Create core documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE.md)
‚Ä¢ Refine module interconnections (genome, lineage, traits, multiverse)
‚Ä¢ Add Adam & Eve test module (structured lineage, loyalty, family caps)


üìà Medium-Term Goals (v1.x)
----------------------------
‚Ä¢ Expand DNA-inspired simulation features (roles, energy, farming mechanics)
‚Ä¢ Add reproducible experiment runner with logs and metrics
‚Ä¢ Implement visualization tools for family trees and multiverse dynamics
‚Ä¢ Integrate Sentient AI (PSAI / mk6) into agents for decision-making
‚Ä¢ Improve CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
‚Ä¢ Publish initial release package to PyPI
‚Ä¢ Provide extended test coverage (Adam & Eve, PSAI, stress tests)


üåç Long-Term Goals (v2.x and beyond)
------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Support large-scale multiverse simulations with parallel execution
‚Ä¢ Introduce advanced modules (e.g., emergent behaviors, subconscious layers)
‚Ä¢ Add support for synthetic DNA inputs for testing
‚Ä¢ Enable full farming & resource management loops (agents produce & manage food)
‚Ä¢ Explore real-world applications:
    - Neural link systems
    - Autonomous vehicles
    - Android integration
‚Ä¢ Collaborate with research communities to extend LifeOS as a standard
  simulation framework


ü§ù How to Contribute
---------------------
‚Ä¢ See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.
‚Ä¢ Discussions and feature proposals are welcome via Issues and Pull Requests.


üìå Note
--------
This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as milestones are achieved.
