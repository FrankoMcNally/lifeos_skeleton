## [2025-09-22] â€“ Stress Tests & Monitoring Validation

### Added
- Conducted **stress test experiments** with configurations:
  - `stress_medium.yaml`
  - `stress_large.yaml`
  - `stress_extreme.yaml`  
- Verified outputs for multiple worlds (`baseline`, `spiritual_communal`, `adaptive`, `competitive`).  
- Integrated **resource monitoring (`monitor_resources.py`)** to track CPU and memory usage during extreme runs.  
- Added `analyze_results_extended.py` for deeper aggregate analysis across experiments.

### Fixed
- Addressed issues with missing `psutil` dependency.  
- Confirmed compatibility with `matplotlib` for metrics visualization.

### Notes
- Stress test proof-of-concept confirms the framework scales to high population and generation counts.  
- Monitoring and extended analysis scripts are now part of the repo for reproducible validation.
